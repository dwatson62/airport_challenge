Airport Challenge
=======================

## Synopsis

Original repo: (https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge)

This was my submission for the airpot challenge, in week 1 of Makers Academy.

It is a project to practice TTD with Ruby and Rspec. It creates an airport where planes can take off and land. Also, it has a random weather generator, where planes cannot take off and land during stormy weather.

## Technologies Used

- Ruby
- Rspec
